# team-7-project

We are team 7, composed of 3 members, Micheale(Seattle, WA), Carla(Cincinnati, OH), and Phi Hai(Seattle, WA). 

Coming from different professions, we found our paths crossing taking this Web Development program through Generations.

We are here to develop a Front End project to display what we have learned through Generation's Program.
